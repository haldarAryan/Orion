            "[296.00 - 300.00]  Maybe there's a massive creature around the outside of this facility, you know, just height like holding onto it.\n",
            "[300.00 - 302.00]  See, that's what happens.\n",
            "[302.00 - 306.00]  My imagination gets the better of me. I just start thinking of crazy things.\n",

            "[331.00 - 332.00]  Oh!\n",

            "[343.00 - 347.00]  And we're on sub level three. I think that message at the beginning said sub level two.\n",
            "[347.00 - 349.00]  To find who we're looking for.\n",
            "[349.00 - 351.00]  This guy didn't make it.\n",

            "[459.00 - 464.00]  Feels a little bit... I mean, I suppose if that's what they're going for with the arcadey feel, I don't know.\n",
            "[465.00 - 467.00]  But, yeah, I prefer not to do that.\n",
            "[467.00 - 469.00]  It'd be nice if there was a choice.\n",
            "[470.00 - 472.00]  Ooh, what is that?\n",
            "[472.00 - 474.00]  A gold blister or something.\n",
            "[475.00 - 478.00]  Can shoot it. I don't want to use the ammunition.\n",

            "[518.00 - 520.00]  I think it was called, is it Deep Rising?\n",
            "[521.00 - 523.00]  Can't remember.\n",
            "[523.00 - 526.00]  I think it might be something along the lines of that.\n",

            "[535.00 - 537.00]  I don't really want to spoil it if you haven't seen it, but...\n",
            "[537.00 - 540.00]  They take over a boat, and a lot of chaos happens.\n",
            "[540.00 - 543.00]  It's like one of those kind of be-horrors, but it was fun.\n",
            "[543.00 - 546.00]  I'm not going near that. It's gonna suck the life out of me.\n",
            "[546.00 - 551.00]  The Irish Red. Can we get anything?\n",

            "[568.00 - 570.00]  Oh! That's really cool looking though.\n",
            "[570.00 - 573.00]  And I actually like how they don't look the same.\n",
            "[577.00 - 580.00]  Here we with the shot then.\n",
            "[580.00 - 582.00]  Gotta make it count.\n",
            "[582.00 - 585.00]  And you don't get stuff off all of them either, and they look different too.\n",
            "[588.00 - 590.00]  Oh, we could've used this.\n",
            "[591.00 - 594.00]  Oh! Oh, you just get to piss out me then.\n",
            "[595.00 - 596.00]  Come on.\n",

            "[600.00 - 603.00]  I like the stagger animation though. That's cool.\n",

            "[606.00 - 609.00]  Find not queuing to... Then we'll do anything.\n",
            "[610.00 - 612.00]  No, you're already infected, aren't you?\n",
            "[612.00 - 614.00]  So yeah, it's not gonna do anything.\n",
            "[616.00 - 618.00]  Oh, look at that!\n",
            "[620.00 - 622.00]  Oh, it's disgusting.\n",
            "[622.00 - 624.00]  Get out of there.\n",
            "[625.00 - 627.00]  I don't want to get too close.\n",
            "[627.00 - 629.00]  Oh, did that hit us?\n",
            "[630.00 - 631.00]  I think it might have.\n",
            "[631.00 - 633.00]  Alright, let's not get too close then.\n",
            "[636.00 - 638.00]  There we go.\n",
            "[639.00 - 641.00]  We'll learn in.\n",
            "[641.00 - 643.00]  Oh, we got grenades.\n",
            "[648.00 - 650.00]  Hello. Did you shoot?\n",
            "[652.00 - 654.00]  Yeah, look at this stagger animation.\n",
            "[654.00 - 656.00]  You catch him on his heels. Look at that.\n",
            "[656.00 - 658.00]  That's cool.\n",
            "[659.00 - 661.00]  Can we follow it up?\n",
            "[662.00 - 664.00]  Oh, I don't know if you can.\n",
            "[665.00 - 668.00]  Yeah, because in some times, with games like this,\n",
            "[668.00 - 670.00]  when you try and hit them too many times in a row,\n",
            "[670.00 - 672.00]  it doesn't always register.\n",
            "[672.00 - 674.00]  Oh, look at that. They digested or something?\n",
            "[674.00 - 675.00]  Oh, oh.\n",
            "[677.00 - 678.00]  Bless.\n",
            "[679.00 - 681.00]  Get the power going.\n",
            "[682.00 - 685.00]  I want to switch to the shotgun for a little bit.\n",
            "[689.00 - 691.00]  Just let round to there.\n",
            "[691.00 - 693.00]  Okay, here we go.\n",
            "[693.00 - 695.00]  Save it.\n",
            "[705.00 - 707.00]  Oh, he's got body armor on.\n",
            "[719.00 - 720.00]  Oh.\n",
            "[726.00 - 728.00]  Okay, we got him.\n",
            "[728.00 - 730.00]  There's more.\n",
            "[731.00 - 734.00]  How are we looking? 74? Should we heal?\n",
            "[734.00 - 736.00]  No, I'm going to save it.\n",
            "[736.00 - 738.00]  Let's go. Go, go, go.\n",
            "[740.00 - 742.00]  Oh, did you hear him?\n",
            "[742.00 - 745.00]  Close the door. That's infected. Get inside. That was cool.\n",
            "[749.00 - 752.00]  You're so stupid, I found it.\n",
            "[755.00 - 757.00]  Oh, areas. It's peaking.\n",
            "[758.00 - 760.00]  Here we can shoot through the glass.\n",
            "[761.00 - 763.00]  Oh, you scared me then.\n",
            "[764.00 - 766.00]  Might need to heal.\n",
            "[766.00 - 768.00]  Yeah, I'm not taking the chance. What is it?\n",
            "[768.00 - 770.00]  Here we go.\n",
            "[779.00 - 782.00]  Oh, okay, we can take that too. Yeah, reload that up.\n",
            "[783.00 - 784.00]  This music.\n",
            "[784.00 - 787.00]  Oh, it's really amping me up.\n",
            "[794.00 - 796.00]  Come on, peak, peak, peak.\n",
            "[799.00 - 802.00]  There's someone like here hiding behind this.\n",
            "[805.00 - 806.00]  There.\n",
            "[809.00 - 811.00]  Come on, come on, come on.\n",
            "[818.00 - 820.00]  Oh, wow, these two of them.\n",
            "[824.00 - 826.00]  Gotta be careful, gotta be careful.\n",
            "[826.00 - 829.00]  Did they just push through then? Oh, they did.\n",
            "[832.00 - 835.00]  That's it. Just keep rushing. I'll take that.\n",
            "[836.00 - 839.00]  Hurry, load, gotta reload, come on, come on, come on.\n",
            "[843.00 - 845.00]  Oh, boy, okay.\n",
            "[847.00 - 849.00]  Yeah, these guys are not playing around.\n",
            "[855.00 - 858.00]  Are we looking like 52? Gotta be careful.\n",
            "[861.00 - 864.00]  I think one of them might have thrown a grenade. I heard an explosion.\n",
            "[866.00 - 867.00]  Another person.\n",
            "[879.00 - 884.00]  Oh, can we shoot these? I don't really want to waste the ammo, but...\n",
            "[884.00 - 886.00]  Okay.\n",
            "[890.00 - 892.00]  Let's get what they had.\n",
            "[893.00 - 895.00]  59553.\n",
            "[898.00 - 901.00]  Okay, so we gotta put in a code somewhere. Oh, this.\n",
            "[902.00 - 905.00]  59553, remember it, guys. Okay.\n",
            "[906.00 - 911.00]  Just trying to make the most of whatever ammunition we can hold onto. Yeah, we got all of that.\n",
            "[911.00 - 914.00]  Yeah, I'm pretty convinced that somebody threw a grenade.\n",
            "[916.00 - 920.00]  Because that hurt. That's what took us down quite a lot.\n",
            "[923.00 - 927.00]  Shotgun didn't seem anywhere near as effective as I thought it would be.\n",
            "[927.00 - 930.00]  59553, let's try this.\n",
            "[931.00 - 932.00]  Yep, there we go.\n",
            "[939.00 - 941.00]  Find the biology team on sub-level two.\n",
            "[953.00 - 955.00]  Team 3, come in.\n",
            "[973.00 - 976.00]  So there on comes then. Like when I take one of them down, they're just...\n",
            "[976.00 - 977.00]  Ooh!\n",
            "[983.00 - 985.00]  Oh, look at that. Oh!\n",
            "[986.00 - 988.00]  So is it a giant creature then?\n",
            "[990.00 - 993.00]  Ooh, look at the things at the end of it. They're like pulsating.\n",
            "[1000.00 - 1003.00]  Yeah, that would squash us no problem.\n",
            "[1005.00 - 1007.00]  Whoa. What?\n",
            "[1012.00 - 1014.00]  Something messing with our mind.\n",
            "[1015.00 - 1018.00]  We gotta go in the water, too. Alright, here we go.\n",
            "[1026.00 - 1029.00]  Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on. Don't like it.\n",
            "[1029.00 - 1032.00]  Look at all that stink that's in the water with us. Get out!\n",
            "[1033.00 - 1045.00]  Objectives, if you're unsure of your next move, press O. It will guide you to where you need to go.\n",
            "[1045.00 - 1046.00]  Okay.\n",
            "[1053.00 - 1057.00]  Whole load of bad. You can just tell why it's down there.\n",
            "[1058.00 - 1059.00]  We'll break this.\n",
            "[1063.00 - 1066.00]  Oh, you can. That's satisfying. Can barely see the glass though.\n",
            "[1069.00 - 1072.00]  Come on. There you go. Squeeze through.\n",
            "[1074.00 - 1076.00]  Look at all that mess.\n",
            "[1077.00 - 1079.00]  Cool lighting though.\n",
            "[1083.00 - 1086.00]  Off we go. Some extra ammunition.\n",
            "[1086.00 - 1089.00]  All the systems of this place are just...\n",
            "[1090.00 - 1092.00]  They're on fire.\n",
            "[1094.00 - 1098.00]  So no doubt that tells me we're probably gonna have to reset them, right?\n",
            "[1098.00 - 1101.00]  It's gonna be a giant breaker somewhere and we're gonna have to fix it.\n",
            "[1101.00 - 1105.00]  It's always the way. We squeeze around there. Oh, yeah, we can.\n",
            "[1106.00 - 1107.00]  Nice.\n",
            "[1109.00 - 1112.00]  Oh, saving. Oh, there's more there.\n",

            "[1646.00 - 1649.00]  And the situation is dire.\n",

            "[1668.00 - 1671.00]  Yeah, this gagged thing is the big bad then.\n",
            "[1673.00 - 1674.00]  Oh, here we go.\n",
            "[1674.00 - 1679.00]  Okay, so we've got weapon parts up there, 27 coating kits, 20.\n",
            "[1679.00 - 1682.00]  So we can't afford anything for the MP5.\n",
            "[1682.00 - 1684.00]  Oh, that breaks my heart a little bit.\n",
            "[1684.00 - 1686.00]  So high capacity magazine.\n",

            "[1755.00 - 1756.00]  Okay.\n",
            "[1756.00 - 1759.00]  I mean, I don't know if I would mess with these.\n",
            "[1759.00 - 1760.00]  Maybe.\n",

            "[1818.00 - 1821.00]  And we upgraded the barrel on this one, right?\n",
            "[1821.00 - 1823.00]  So this is going to give us a little bit more damage.\n",
            "[1823.00 - 1824.00]  That's nice.\n",
            "[1827.00 - 1828.00]  Yeah, so she said...\n",

            "[1837.00 - 1838.00]  As well.\n",
            "[1841.00 - 1842.00]  Oh, no.\n",

            "[1852.00 - 1854.00]  when I say, oh my god, fuses.\n",
            "[1854.00 - 1856.00]  It's the pain of my life.\n",

            "[2082.00 - 2083.00]  Okay, how we're looking?\n",

            "[2252.00 - 2253.00]  Oh!\n",
            "[2255.00 - 2256.00]  You reloading?\n",
            "[2256.00 - 2258.00]  Okay, thank you for telling me.\n",
            "[2259.00 - 2262.00]  How are we looking? How are we looking? 64? Okay, wow!\n",
            "[2263.00 - 2265.00]  We need ammunition so bad.\n",
            "[2268.00 - 2269.00]  Oh, okay.\n",
            "[2269.00 - 2270.00]  A little bit jumpy.\n",

            "[2271.00 - 2272.00]  Keep the shotgun out.\n",
            "[2277.00 - 2278.00]  Don't do that!\n",
            "[2280.00 - 2282.00]  You see, they're crazy in this arm up!\n",
            "[2283.00 - 2287.00]  I think that was a good call where I just kind of stayed there and then wait for them to come out here.\n",
            "[2287.00 - 2289.00]  I think I took two or three of them down.\n",
            "[2289.00 - 2290.00]  Right.\n",
            "[2291.00 - 2293.00]  Okay, reloaded, we're good.\n",
            "[2293.00 - 2295.00]  MP5, got some rounds for that too.\n",

            "[2300.00 - 2302.00]  And okay, we're back up.\n",
            "[2312.00 - 2317.00]  So you really do, you have to conserve what ammo you have and anything you can recover from these guys.\n",
            "[2317.00 - 2319.00]  You absolutely have to.\n",
            "[2321.00 - 2323.00]  Like I was saying, it's...\n",

            "[2328.00 - 2331.00]  What was it, the hard bastard setting was?\n",
            "[2333.00 - 2338.00]  In the fact that you can't maneuver either, like, run away because of this power cell, I should be careful there.\n",
            "[2343.00 - 2344.00]  Okay.\n",
            "[2356.00 - 2358.00]  Oh, I'm gonna need to take the other one...\n",
            "[2358.00 - 2361.00]  Oh, you know what, they're gonna bring more forces in.\n",
            "[2363.00 - 2368.00]  I've just realized when I saw this, I was like, wait, we need another one and then the one that we've already put in there.\n",
            "[2369.00 - 2371.00]  Alright, let's go back.\n",
            "[2375.00 - 2377.00]  One step at a time.\n",
            "[2377.00 - 2379.00]  Take it easy, don't panic.\n",
            "[2386.00 - 2388.00]  I think we're doing this right.\n",
            "[2388.00 - 2392.00]  Because this is the only other power cell I can remember seeing.\n",
            "[2394.00 - 2396.00]  Oh, it didn't close it, okay, it just keeps it open.\n",
            "[2399.00 - 2400.00]  Let's get back.\n",
            "[2400.00 - 2403.00]  Switch to this, just in case they bring more of the...\n",
            "[2403.00 - 2404.00]  The teams in.\n",
            "[2408.00 - 2410.00]  Oh, my God!\n",
            "[2417.00 - 2419.00]  Someone's whispering.\n",
            "[2419.00 - 2422.00]  Oh, don't you do it, don't you re-animate these things.\n",
            "[2422.00 - 2427.00]  If I see their arms, go at like, clicking back into, you know, like doing that thing, like zombies do.\n",
            "[2429.00 - 2431.00]  Why did I say that? That's probably gonna happen now.\n",
            "[2434.00 - 2436.00]  Oh, that's so creepy!\n",
            "[2436.00 - 2437.00]  Oh!\n",
            "[2441.00 - 2443.00]  Focus, come on.\n",

            "[2459.00 - 2465.00]  What's that? That was something... That was a human, like, in shots as crawling across the floor.\n",
            "[2465.00 - 2467.00]  So what is this creature, this gaggiff?\n",
            "[2468.00 - 2470.00]  Is it mind controlling people?\n",
            "[2471.00 - 2473.00]  Just get that in there.\n",

            "[2491.00 - 2494.00]  We definitely can't get anything out of these. I'm gonna break one.\n",
            "[2497.00 - 2502.00]  I'm making me feel a bit better. Oh, yeah. Get destroyed.\n",
            "[2505.00 - 2508.00]  Okay, so in here.\n",
            "[2509.00 - 2511.00]  Okay, so in here.\n",
            "[2517.00 - 2522.00]  After narrowly escaping the duck explosion, Quinn slipped into. Okay, I couldn't read that.\n",
            "[2530.00 - 2535.00]  Ooh. So we at sub-level two now, because we've just gone from three, right?\n",
            "[2535.00 - 2537.00]  It's not telling me.\n",
            "[2539.00 - 2541.00]  Oh, yes, please. Give me all those.\n",
            "[2542.00 - 2544.00]  Oh, we got... Ooh! Two grenades!\n",
            "[2547.00 - 2549.00]  What was this over here?\n",
            "[2552.00 - 2553.00]  What are you? Oh.\n",
            "[2553.00 - 2555.00]  Oh, they're lockers.\n",
            "[2555.00 - 2557.00]  Some health? Are we okay?\n",
            "[2562.00 - 2564.00]  Let's just use that.\n",
            "[2569.00 - 2577.00]  I like how it's gone from being a lot of chaos fighting the security teams or whatever they are.\n",
            "[2577.00 - 2582.00]  To like this slow buildup of the horror now, though. I do like that contrast. That's cool.\n",
            "[2583.00 - 2588.00]  There are a few things that I would love to change in this, like just for personal preference.\n",
            "[2588.00 - 2591.00]  Again, this is just for self-ish reason. I mean, it's a shellfish.\n",
            "[2591.00 - 2594.00]  Selfish reasons. The first thing would be this.\n",
            "[2595.00 - 2599.00]  I really, really don't like this. It's a huge put off for me.\n",
            "[2599.00 - 2602.00]  I'd love to be able to ADS with the weapon.\n",
            "[2604.00 - 2609.00]  They've got to make sure that the performance is running the best it possibly can.\n",
            "[2611.00 - 2613.00]  I don't know. Is this a little bit too heavy as well on the...\n",
            "[2613.00 - 2618.00]  Like the dust or the smoke that's being kicked up? I think that might be intentional, though, so...\n",
            "[2620.00 - 2622.00]  We can't see too far ahead.\n",
            "[2623.00 - 2629.00]  The weapon thing, I don't know. It's a thing that really bugs me every time I experience it in a video game.\n",
            "[2633.00 - 2637.00]  Again, just personal preference. You guys might not be bothered by it, but...\n",
            "[2637.00 - 2640.00]  All in all, it's a good time.\n",
            "[2640.00 - 2641.00]  Oh, yeah.\n",
            "[2651.00 - 2652.00]  Talking about me.\n",
            "[2653.00 - 2654.00]  Tritch your mouth.\n",
            "[2661.00 - 2663.00]  Oh, yeah, that's how you do it.\n",
            "[2665.00 - 2666.00]  Oh, we got more. Okay.\n",
            "[2667.00 - 2668.00]  Get him.\n",
            "[2668.00 - 2670.00]  Oh, there we go. Come on. Come on.\n",
            "[2676.00 - 2678.00]  He's like back there somewhere. I can't see him.\n",
            "[2683.00 - 2685.00]  Still got some rounds. We're good.\n",
            "[2686.00 - 2688.00]  Nice. Oh, we got a barrel there.\n",
            "[2689.00 - 2690.00]  Yeah!\n",
            "[2691.00 - 2692.00]  Get down.\n",
            "[2695.00 - 2697.00]  Look at that, the destruction, too. I love that.\n",
            "[2699.00 - 2704.00]  How sick would it be if it took out one of the pillars or something from doing that?\n",
            "[2707.00 - 2708.00]  Oh, let me in.\n",
            "[2711.00 - 2712.00]  Nothing?\n",
            "[2712.00 - 2717.00]  Listen to that music. Got that really, really. It lets you know you're in a fight.\n",
            "[2721.00 - 2723.00]  Give me all your bits. Keep your leg down.\n",
            "[2724.00 - 2727.00]  Reload.\n",
            "[2729.00 - 2731.00]  Oh, yeah.\n",
            "[2735.00 - 2737.00]  Got a some down here.\n",
            "[2742.00 - 2744.00]  Another one over there.\n",
            "[2747.00 - 2748.00]  I can't see him.\n",
            "[2753.00 - 2755.00]  Oh, my god. He won't go down.\n",
            "[2758.00 - 2759.00]  He will.\n",
            "[2763.00 - 2765.00]  Reload. Reload.\n",
            "[2772.00 - 2774.00]  Is he down?\n",
            "[2775.00 - 2777.00]  Okay, we got a door.\n",
            "[2780.00 - 2783.00]  The weird, flailing body parts.\n",
            "[2784.00 - 2786.00]  Is this?\n",
            "[2789.00 - 2793.00]  Yeah, they don't mess around. It's actually quite cool fighting those guys.\n",
            "[2793.00 - 2797.00]  I don't know. The combat feels just a bit clunky.\n",
            "[2797.00 - 2800.00]  I can't quite put my finger on it.\n",
            "[2800.00 - 2802.00]  It's just, I can't do it.\n",
            "[2803.00 - 2807.00]  It's just, I guess with the way the weapon is and not being able to ADS.\n",
            "[2807.00 - 2810.00]  I don't know. There's just something about it. It's not a sad...\n",
            "[2821.00 - 2823.00]  Oh, friendly.\n",
            "[2828.00 - 2829.00]  Hey.\n",
            "[2830.00 - 2832.00]  Just hosted my weapon.\n",
            "[2832.00 - 2834.00]  You okay?\n",
            "[2838.00 - 2840.00]  It's like a safe zone or something.\n",
            "[2860.00 - 2862.00]  Over there?\n",
            "[2863.00 - 2864.00]  Hey.\n",
            "[2865.00 - 2867.00]  Huh? Hello?\n",
            "[2878.00 - 2881.00]  Thanks, man. You got some more of that Kevlar?\n",
            "[2881.00 - 2884.00]  Or any more ammunition? Could use it.\n",
            "[2884.00 - 2886.00]  Hey, is this the dock?\n",
            "[2887.00 - 2890.00]  Okay, we got some flickering screens.\n",
            "[2895.00 - 2897.00]  What's the plan?\n",
            "[2900.00 - 2903.00]  So, let me explain our situation first.\n",
            "[2903.00 - 2906.00]  There are five stations here on the ocean floor.\n",
            "[2906.00 - 2913.00]  And at the center of them all is an emitter tower that operates on a special frequency, designed to scare the sea creatures away.\n",
            "[2913.00 - 2922.00]  This tower enabled us to move freely around this area, but unfortunately, the signal was turned off with the recent power outages.\n",
            "[2923.00 - 2925.00]  What can we do then?\n",
            "[2925.00 - 2930.00]  We need to reactivate the signal from the tower, but we can't while it's in lockdown.\n",
            "[2930.00 - 2935.00]  And we can't deactivate the lockdown without the tower officer, who's missing.\n",
            "[2936.00 - 2938.00]  So what now?\n",
            "[2938.00 - 2941.00]  I have a special flash drive in my quarters on level four.\n",
            "[2941.00 - 2945.00]  I can try and use it to hack the system and gain access to the tower.\n",
            "[2946.00 - 2953.00]  I'm hoping that if I can reactivate the tower, it'll send not only those creatures away, but also the Gaguth.\n",
            "[2953.00 - 2956.00]  The Gaguth? What's that?\n",
            "[2956.00 - 2958.00]  Seriously?\n",
            "[2958.00 - 2963.00]  By some miracle, you must have managed to steer clear of that thing.\n",
            "[2963.00 - 2968.00]  It's a creature that's loose on this station. It's unstoppable.\n",
            "[2968.00 - 2972.00]  And the reason why half of the crew are already dead.\n",
            "[2972.00 - 2977.00]  If you happen to find it, don't try to fight. Just run. Run fast.\n",
            "[2977.00 - 2979.00]  Okay.\n",
            "[2979.00 - 2984.00]  Okay, I'll try to avoid that thing. I'll get the flash drive, but my daughter's running out of time.\n",
            "[2984.00 - 2992.00]  Agreed. The main route to sub-level four is blocked, but there's an alternate entrance via a maintenance room located on the west side of the station.\n",
            "[2994.00 - 2998.00]  Okay, find the maintenance room secondary access.\n",
            "[2998.00 - 3007.00]  I could have really done without the flicker and TV's behind the character while she was talking, and the mouth movements are a little bit distracting, but okay, I cannot be worked on.\n",
            "[3007.00 - 3009.00]  And don't worry, I'll run fast.\n",
            "[3009.00 - 3012.00]  Okay, very dramatic. I'm here for the drama.\n",
            "[3012.00 - 3019.00]  Right, so he says, find the maintenance room secondary access because there was a blocky drive.\n",
            "[3019.00 - 3023.00]  It's gonna go this way.\n",
            "[3023.00 - 3025.00]  Still no weapons up.\n",
            "[3025.00 - 3029.00]  Oh no, that's the end. I wanted to see the Gaggith.\n",
            "[3086.00 - 3096.00]  Okay, so even getting a bit of a sneak peek as to what's to come, and I think we've just laid our eyes on the creature everyone's been talking about, the Gaggith, unless that was something totally different.\n",
            "[3096.00 - 3108.00]  And I'm starting to think that with these infected, with the tentacles, with the creatures and all the weird stuff that's going on, is there some kind of hive mind going on in this facility?\n",
            "[3108.00 - 3116.00]  If you guys have ever heard me mention the movie underwater, with Kristen Stewart, it takes place it like the bottom of the ocean. It's really good. I really liked it.\n",
            "[3116.00 - 3123.00]  I'm getting that kind of vibe from this. And if it is anything along the lines of that, then I think we'll have a good time with it.\n",
            "[3123.00 - 3129.00]  It definitely needs a lot more polish. The dialogue needs to be a lot tighter, and I think there's one too many flashing lights.\n",
            "[3129.00 - 3134.00]  We could do with a little less flashing lights, and the gun plate, if that gets sharpened up a little bit more.\n",
            "[3134.00 - 3146.00]  I don't know, we could be onto something with this one. So if you guys do want to see more of it, and please let me know down in the comments, drop a like on the video if you enjoyed, and I'll see you all in the next one.\n",
